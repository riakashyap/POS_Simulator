# POS_Simulator

The purpose of this project is to develop a Point of Sale (POS) 
simulator using Java that simulates the behaviour of a real-life 
POS system. The simulator should be able to perform basic 
operations such as automatically update the inventory, 
calculating the total price, applying discounts, processing 
payments, saving the feedbacks. The simulator should have a 
user-friendly interface that allows users to interact with the 
system easily. It should provide error messages when necessary.
The simulator should be designed to be extensible, allowing 
additional functionality to be added in the future.
